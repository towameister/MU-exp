This repository contains the code used to generate the experimental results for the deletion-efficient k-means algorithms, which were presented in the Paper "Making AI Forget You:
Data Deletion in Machine Learning" by Ginart et al. The code has largely been forked from Ginarts own implementation, which can be found [here](https://github.com/tginart/deletion-efficient-kmeans). https://github.com/tginart/deletion-efficient-kmeans

the dataset file used in the code can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LqazOJuH3uOgFxHtBodwon6htEE2Wq13).



before running the experiments with ``python experiments.py``, be sure to install the necessary packages with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``. The results will be printed to the console.
